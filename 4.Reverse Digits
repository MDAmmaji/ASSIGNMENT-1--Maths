QUESTION:
     Reverse Digits.

ALGORITHM:
STEP-1) Take rev_num to hold reversed number and make it long to match n type.
STEP-2)check each digit of n to add them to rev_num for that 
       use while and check until n becomes<=0 which means no more digits to check.
STEP-3)rev_num=rev_num*10 + n%10 => this is because each digit in n is added to rev_num supposed to be in correct place 
       like tens, hundreads places should match in rev number .
STEP-4) delete checked digit by n=n/10.
STEP-5) return rev_num.

CODE:
class Solution
{
    public long reverse_digit(long n)
    {
    //to match type of n have taken rev_num as long
         long rev_num = 0; 
    //if n<=0 no more digits to check, while is checking only unchecked digits
        while (n > 0) { 
      //need to do rev_num*10 as prev rev_num no longer in units place 
            rev_num = rev_num * 10 + n % 10; 
            //to delete checked digit n= n/10
            n = n / 10; 
        } 
        return rev_num; 
    }
}
