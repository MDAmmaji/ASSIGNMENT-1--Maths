QUESTION:
    Addition of Two Numbers.

ALGORITHM:
    STEP-1. Read A and B values as input.
    STEP-2. using bits manipulation
              Calculate the carry by performing bitwise AND
              Calculate the sum without considering carry by performing bitwise XOR
              Left-shift the carry to add to the next bit position

CODE:
1.
class Solution{
    static int addition(int A, int B){
            return A+B;
    }
}

2.
class Solution{
    static int addition(int a, int b){
      
        while (b != 0) {
            int carry = a & b;
            a = a ^ b;         
            b = carry << 1;   
        }
        return a;
    }
}
